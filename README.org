* FUNCompiler

I don't really have a plan, I just want to make a compiler; it sounds
fun. There's an example of some code that should be valid and able to
be compiled in ~example~.

NOTE: Shell commands shown assume a working directory of this repository.

** Usage

Run the executable from a shell with a path to some source code as the
only argument. Currently, we print out the furthest progress we are
able to make. Eventually, we will output compiled source code.

** Building

Dependencies:

- [[https://cmake.org/][CMake >= 3.14]]

- Any C Compiler (We like [[https://gcc.gnu.org/][GCC]])

First, generate a build tree using CMake.
#+begin_src shell
  cmake -B bld
#+end_src

Finally, build an executable from the build tree.
#+begin_src shell
  cmake --build bld
#+end_src

** To build generated x86_64 ASM

On Windows under MinGW:
#+begin_src shell
  as code.S -o code.o
  ld code.o -o code.exe && code.exe
#+end_src
